# Power Rule

The power rule states that the derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{(n-1)}$

## Example:
Find the derivative of $x^2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 &= 2x^{(2-1)} \\
&=2x^1 \\
&=2x \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The derivative of $x^2$ is $2x$.


## Example 2:
Find the derivative of $x^3$

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^3 &= 3x^{(3-1)} \\
&=3x^2
\end{aligned}
$$

The derivative of $x^3$ is $3x^2$.
