# Constants in Derivatives
Constants have a variety of different effects on derivatives depending on their placement.

## Derivative of a Constant
The derivative of a constant is always zero.

Remember, a constant is any number that does not change. This can include special numbers, such as $\pi$ and $e$.

### Examples:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&f\prime(3) = 0 \\ \\
&f\prime(-9/5) = 0 \\ \\
&f\prime(\pi) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Added/Subtracted Constants
Constants that are added or subtracted in an equation have no bearing on the derivative. No changes occur.

### Examples:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&(x^2)\prime=2x \\ \\
&(x^2+50)\prime=2x \\ \\
&(x^2-10)\prime=2x
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multiplication/Division
Multiplication and division operations applied to variables are calculated AFTER finding the derivative of the base variable.

### Example:
Find the derivative of $4x^2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(4x^2)\prime&=(4)(x^2)\prime \\
(x^2)\prime&= 2x \\
(4)(x^2)\prime&= (4)(2x) \\
&=8x \\
(4x^2)\prime&=8x
\end{aligned}
$$
